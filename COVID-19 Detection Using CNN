🧠 COVID-19 Detection Using CNN
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using the publicly available COVID-19 Image Dataset on Kaggle.

📁 Dataset
The dataset contains chest X-ray images categorized into two classes:
-Normal

-Viral Pneumonia

These labeled images help train and evaluate the performance of the CNN model in distinguishing between healthy individuals and those with COVID-19 or other forms of pneumonia.

🛠️ Project Features
Preprocessing of image data (resizing, normalization)

CNN architecture built using TensorFlow/Keras

Model training, validation, and evaluation

Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Visualization of training history and confusion matrix

📊 Results
The trained model achieves strong performance in detecting COVID-19 from X-ray scans, with promising results in terms of classification accuracy and generalization.

🚀 Future Improvements
Incorporate transfer learning using pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet

Expand dataset with more diverse X-ray images

Deploy the model as a web or mobile application for real-time predictions
